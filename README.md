# TNF Gene Sequence Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive sequence analysis of the human TNF gene. The analysis was performed using various bioinformatics tools to explore the gene's structure, function, and regulation. The steps involved in this analysis include downloading the sequence, translating it, identifying open reading frames (ORFs), analyzing sequence composition, identifying transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding or non-coding regions, and converting sequence file formats.

## Folder Structure

- **Data/**  
  Contains the raw data files used in the analysis. This includes sequence files in FASTA format and other relevant datasets.
  
- **Figures/**  
  Stores all the images, screenshots, and figures generated during the analysis. These include graphical outputs from tools like BioEdit, PROMO, MEME Suite, and GENSCAN.
  
- **Outputs/**  
  Contains the result files from the analysis. This includes the outputs from ORF analysis, motif searches, transcription factor binding site identification, and sequence composition analysis.
  
- **Report/**  
  Includes the final report summarizing the entire project. The report details the methods used, results obtained, and interpretations. The report is provided in PDF format.

   - Tools: GENSCAN

8. **Convert Between Sequence File Formats Using BioEdit (FASTA to PHYLIP)**
   - Objective: Convert the TNF gene sequence from FASTA format to PHYLIP format.
   - Tools: BioEdit

## Discussion and Future Directions

This project provides valuable insights into the structure, function, and regulation of the TNF gene. The identification of multiple ORFs, transcription factor binding sites, and functional motifs suggests that the TNF gene plays a critical role in various biological processes, particularly in immune responses. Future research could focus on experimental validation of these findings and exploring the gene's role in different populations to better understand its involvement in disease susceptibility.
